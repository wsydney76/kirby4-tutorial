Crochet requires patience, creativity and precision. With each stitch, I have to focus on the current pattern while keeping an eye on the big picture. This ability to pay attention to details while still keeping track of the big picture is invaluable in software development. When developing code, it's important to both pay attention to the small details and keep the big picture in mind to create high-quality, robust software.</p><p>In addition, crochet gives me the opportunity to explore my creative side. I can design patterns, combine colors, and create unique pieces. This creativity also feeds into my work as a software developer. When designing and implementing software solutions, I have the opportunity to implement innovative ideas and develop customized solutions that meet my clients' needs.</p>"},"id":"57aa55c5-642b-4ec3-beb7-158dfaeb0735","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}],"id":"ed8fd9bd-d17a-4c43-bdc4-7eebed05ac61","width":"2/3"},{"blocks":[{"content":{"image":["file://V8CUMYThnnIRMazm"]},"id":"78bd3159-3367-4c95-9eb1-93aa02129937","isHidden":false,"type":"coverImage"}],"id":"0c71d416-9acb-4d7c-a231-86f404b2ac43","width":"1/3"}],"id":"38f6bf8e-f112-4f55-9df1-50e5b611b0e2"},{"attrs":{"class":"","id":"","image":[]},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Summary"},"id":"e4a4c567-ecf5-422a-94ff-efb58c1cf196","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>In summary, mountaineering and crocheting are two seemingly different hobbies, but they shape my thinking and approach as a software developer.
